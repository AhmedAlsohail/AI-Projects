# AI-Project
In this repository, I will be sharing the projects I created during my journey in learning AI algorithms such as DFS and minimax.

## Projects

### DFS maze solver (C#)
A challenge for creating a maze solver for nxn size mazes.
______________________
### Tic Tac Toe AI (Python)
Tic Tac Toe AI agent using minimax algorithm, both game and agent were created from scratch.
